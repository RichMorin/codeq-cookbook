Devin Walters ([devn]) has created the nifty [codeq-playground], billed as:

> A quick and easy way to play around with queries
> against your Clojure Git repositories.
> ...
> codeq-playground includes a few examples of what you can do with Codeq.
> They’re stolen liberally from the Codeq blog post and from Rich Hickey’s
> unsession talk on Codeq at Clojure/conj 2012

The examples (in the codeq-playground [core.clj]) look very useful (if largely undocumented).
Basically, they contain Clojure-based queries and rules for use with Codeq.
With this as inspiration, I have created this "Codeq Cookbook".

I have edited query examples from codeq-playground into [wiki pages],
adding information about caveats, idioms, motivation, use, etc.
Each page is formatted as a standardized set of sections
(reminiscent of Unix man pages).
The content mimics that of assorted "Foo Cookbook" volumes.

This cookbook concentrates on Codeq-specific recipes.
For Datomic-specific recipes, see [datomic-cookbook].
